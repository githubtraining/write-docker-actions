## Explore your input parameters

Take a few minutes to play with the current code you have. I don't suggest editing the `main.go`, `Dockerfile`, or `action.yml` files, rather I think there is a lot to gain by changing the `my-workflow.yml` file to include or exclude certain input parameters.

### :keyboard: Activity: View the results of changing input parameters

1. Remove all the input parameters from the `my-workflow.yml` file. What happens when your action executes?
2. Add all three input parameter and be explicit with their values in the `my-workflow.yml` file. What happens when your action executes?
3. Specify only the `third-greeting` input parameter in the `my-workflow.yml` file. what happens when your action executes?

When you are finished experimenting and examining the results merge this pull request into the **main** branch.

Our next lesson will show you how to add external libraries to an action as well as interact with external APIs.

When I notice that you have **merged this branch** I will open a new issue in your repository to continue guiding you.
