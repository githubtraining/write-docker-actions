## You have triggered a workflow!

Great job adding the workflow. Adding that file to this branch is enough for GitHub Actions to begin running on your repository. The time this takes will vary based on the complexity of the workflow. At this point we can ignore the workflow because it doesn't do anything yet, but while this runs I'll briefly explain the components of the workflow you just added.

If you want to inspect your running workflow you can do so by heading over to the [Actions tab]({{ store.actionsUrl }}) of this repository.
